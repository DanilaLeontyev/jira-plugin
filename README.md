# jira-plugin README

<br>Inspired by [vscode-jira](https://github.com/KnisterPeter/vscode-jira) I decided to create my own JIRA plugin for VS Code.<br>
I'm happy to will implement more features. :blush: <br><br>

## Install

ext install jira-plugin<br><br>

## Usage

From the command palette Ctrl-Shift-P (Windows, Linux) or Cmd-Shift-P (OSX) under **Jira-plugin** you have all the extension commands.<br><br>

## Setup

First of all your have to launch "Setup credentials" command to configure the plugin.<br>
The Jira base URL is needed and also your credentials.<br>

## Set working project

After setup you have to set the working project, you can click on status-bar icon or use "Set working project" command.<br><br>
**n.b:** If you need to browse issues for various project you have to switch the working project.<br>

## Config

The extension store credentials in VS Code settings.<br><br>
**n.b:** the extension store the password in VS Code internal storage so it's safe and hidden. :wink: <br>

### Working issue

- The extension in the status bar show the **working issue**, you can also change it from here. <br>
  You can choose working issue from your **In Progress** issues. <br>
  The extension trace the time spended on the working issue and you can also create the Jira worklog for the activity. <br>
  Jira worklog allow only time in minute so the extension round your activity time. <br>
  The extension **every 60 second** store in iternal storage the current working activity so if you close and reopen VS Code the extension retrive (if needed) the pending working issue.
