# jira-plugin README

<br>Inspired by [vscode-jira](https://github.com/KnisterPeter/vscode-jira) I decided to create my own JIRA plugin for VS Code.
I added more functionality and I'm happy to will implement more.<br><br>

## Setup

First of all your have to lunch "Setup credentials" command to configure the plugin.<br>
The Jira base URL is needed and also your credentials.<br>
After that you have to setup the working project. ("Set working project" command)<br><br>
<b>n.b:</b> If you need to browse issues for various project you have to launch the command to perform the switch.<br><br>

## Features

<br>
- <b>Issue by id</b><br>
  With this command you can search and view a issue by id.<br><br>
- <b>My issues filtered by status</b><br>
  With this command you can search your issues with a particular status.<br><br>
- <b>Issues filtered by status and assignee</b><br>
  With this command you can search issues with a particular assignee and status.<br><br>
- <b>Change issue status (filter: id)</b><br>
  With this command you can change an issue status. In the filter you have to specify the id. <br><br>
- <b>Change issue assignee (filter: id)</b><br>
  With this command you can change an issue assignee. In the filter you have to specify the id.<br><br>
